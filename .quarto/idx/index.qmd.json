By providing a transparent and accurate assessment of GHG emissions, the inventory serves as a critical tool for informing national climate policies, identifying mitigation opportunities, and tracking progress toward Tanzania’s climate goals.\n\nThis National Inventory Report (NIR) presents Tanzania’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals for the period 1990 to 2022, with a focus on the years 2010 to 2021 to reflect the country’s current economic conditions. The inventory adheres to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines and follows the Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3 methodologies, depending on data availability and sector-specific requirements. The report covers emissions from key sectors, including Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU), and Waste, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of Tanzania’s GHG profile.\n\nThe inventory was developed through a collaborative effort led by the Vice President’s Office (VPO) – Division of Environment, with support from the National Carbon Monitoring Center (NCMC). Sector-specific data collection and analysis were conducted by Sector Working Groups, consisting experts from relevant ministries, agencies, and research institutions. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) played a critical role in providing and validating key data, while research institutions and academia contributed technical expertise and methodological improvements.\n\nKey findings from the inventory include:\n\n1. **Energy Sector** -- emissions from fossil fuel combustion and fugitive sources remain the largest contributor to Tanzania’s GHG emissions, driven by increasing energy demand and economic growth.\n\n1. **IPPU Sector** -- emissions from industrial processes, such as cement production, are relatively low but are expected to grow with industrial expansion.\n\n1. **AFOLU Sector** -- emissions from agriculture and land-use changes, particularly deforestation, are significant, while removals from afforestation and reforestation efforts are gradually increasing.\n\n1. **Waste Sector** -- emissions from solid waste disposal and wastewater treatment are rising due to urbanization and population growth, highlighting the need for improved waste management practices.\n\nThe inventory also highlights the challenges of data collection in a data-scarce environment, particularly for sectors like waste and agriculture. To address these challenges, Tanzania has implemented capacity-building programs and strengthened its institutional framework for GHG reporting. The authorization of the NCMC marks a significant step forward in enhancing Tanzania’s carbon monitoring and verification capabilities.\n\n## Acknowledgement {.unnumbered}\n\nThe successful completion of this  National Inventory Report (NIR) would not have been possible without the collaborative efforts and contributions of numerous individuals, institutions, and stakeholders. We extend our sincere gratitude to all those who played a role in this important endeavor. First and foremost, we acknowledge the leadership and support of the Vice President’s Office (VPO) – Division of Environment, which provided the overall coordination and policy guidance necessary for this work. The the National Carbon Monitoring Center (NCMC) has been instrumental in enhancing Tanzania’s capacity for carbon monitoring and climate change reporting.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to the Sector Working Groups for their dedication and expertise in collecting and analyzing data across key sectors, including Energy, Industrial Processes and Product Use (IPPU), Waste, Agriculture, and Forestry and Other Land Use (FOLU). Their efforts ensured the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the inventory. Special thanks go to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) for providing critical statistical data and validating the activity data used in this report. The collaboration with Research Institutions and Academia was invaluable in developing country-specific emission factors and advancing methodological improvements.\n\nWe also recognize the pivotal role of NCMC in overseeing the inventory process, implementing capacity-building programs, and ensuring the timely completion of this report. Their commitment to quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) has significantly enhanced the reliability of the inventory. The support of the Capacity Building Programs and the robust Legal and Policy Frameworks provided the foundation for this work, enabling Tanzania to meet its international obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\n\nFinally, we extend our appreciation to all government departments, public entities, and stakeholders who contributed data, insights, and expertise to this process. Your collective efforts have made it possible to produce a transparent, accurate, and credible GHG inventory that will support Tanzania’s climate action goals and contribute to global efforts to address climate change.\n\n\n# Technical contributors {.unumbered}\n\n\n```{r}\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, gt)\n\n```\n\n\n```{r}\n\n# Coordinators\ncoordinators <- data.frame(\n  Name = c(\"Eng.
